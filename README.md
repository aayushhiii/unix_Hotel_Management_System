# unix_Hotel_Management_System

The Project involves shell scripting where I have developed a Hotel Management System where I have created two logins :

1.Hotel Login
Here the Hotel administrator can create the Backup of Guest, Delete their entry , Remove or Modify Guest's Information and can retrieve Guest Details

2. Guest Login
Here, Guest can create his new profile,
know his/her Booking Details , Generate their bill , Know Their Booking Status.
